# README

This repository is a skeleton for exploratory analyses of air quality data in the San Francisco Bay Area (SFBA), pre- _vs._ post- "COVID-19". Please read the sections below before running the code. If you have questions, please contact <a href="mailto:dholstius@baaqmd.gov">David Holstius</a>. Thank you!

## TODO

- handle non-normal, not-strictly-positive distribution
    - true values are non-negative, but some measurements are negative
    - true values are right-skewed, and so are the measurements
    - somehow model a two-part process (second part is additive error) using Stan?
    - somehow transform data to "approximately normal" in a way that is reasonable?

- construct explicit counterfactual using data from 2019, 2018, ...
    - look at [`fable`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fable/index.html) package 
    - look at [`prophet`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/prophet/index.html) package

- exploit / account for covariance:
    - within each (site, pollutant) series (e.g. temporal autocorrelation)
    - between different pollutants measured at the same site
    - between sites (e.g. using [`spatstat`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spatstat/index.html))
    
## Setup and Data

`00-setup.R` should be run first. It:
- loads the requisite libraries
- defines a function `with_epoch()` that:
    - creates a new `epoch` column with values "Pre", "Post", or `NA` 
    - handles the assumption that **most large effects would not plausibly be instantaneous**
        - they might play out over several days or even weeks 
        - thus, here we provide for "Pre" and "Post" to be separated by a "transition" interval
        - if `na.rm = FALSE`, then within the transition interval, epoch is set to `NA`
    - accepts your definition of `transition_start` and `transition_end`
   
`01-harvest-1h.R` pulls hourly data 
- *for the entire state of California*
- from [AirNowTech.org](http://airnowtech.org)
- using the [`BAAQMD/cacher`](https://github.com/BAAQMD/cacher) package
    - to cache the results locally
    - backed by the high-performance [`.fst`](http://www.fstpackage.org) format for tabular data

After running `01-harvest-1h.R`, the approximate size of `./cache/` will be **~50 Mb for 1h California data from Jan 01 through May 13, 2020**.

## Exploratory Work

`02-chart-1h-PM25.R` generates a quick stripchart of PM2.5, faceted by site. This chart:
- shows most of the data
    - Y-axis is (visually) clipped at -5 and 35 Âµg/m^3
    - no datapoints are actually dropped, so the (displayed) group means are accurate
- shows means for both "Pre" and "Post"

`03-model-1h-PM25.R` is a rough start. These models have been fit:
- simple linear model with fixed effect by `AQSID` (i.e., montoring site ID)
- simple mixed-effects model using `lme4`

See **TODO** (above) for some ideas for next steps.
